    The order list displays all orders that have been submitted
    but not picked up.
    <br />
    Orders are listed in the order in which they were recieved.
    <h3>Changing order status</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select "Update" in the order row.</li>
        <li>
            On the page that appears, select a new status from the dropdown.
        </li>
        <li>Select the "Update Status" button.</li>
    </ul>
    Statuses will update whenever the page is refreshed.
    <br />
    You can typically use your browser's refresh button to do this.
    <br />
    <b>
        However, if you refresh and receive a message asking whether
        to resubmit the form, <i>please do not select yes.</i>
    </b>
    <br />
    Instead, use the "Refresh" button above the order table.
    <h3>WARNING!</h3>
    Once an order has been set as "Picked Up",
    it will be removed from the list.
    <br />
    <b>DO NOT</b> select this status if the order is not yet complete.
